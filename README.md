# riotapi

A very simple [Riot API](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis) example.

Right now it only allows API calls for TR server. 

In order to initiate an API call, one must generate API code for themselves and change the apiKey variable in globals.js

In the future want to make it compatible for multiple regions and register the app with Riot games to build an [OP.GG](https://www.op.gg/) like project.
